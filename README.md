# Resources to use in preparation & during CodeWars 

#### Create a new repository using this template to use the following features:

- An automatic problem checker that tests against all student datasets. 
  - Instructions for use are in the comments of `prob_checker.py`

- A references folder containing various code snippets to copy paste and assist in solving problems.

#### Setup Instructions

- A repository should be created from the template then cloned onto your device **before** contest day
  - The following instructions can also be tested the day before using the early release of problem 00 + 01 files

- On contest day, download the provided zip file from HPE CodeWars and extract the `student_datasets` and `files` folders
  - Existing placeholder files should be deleted and replaced with the ones you extract
  - Make sure to place them in the root directory of your project folder
