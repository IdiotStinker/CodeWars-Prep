### Create a new repository using this template to use the following features:

  - Instructions for use are in the comments of prob_checker.py

- A references folder containing various code snippets to copy paste and assist in solving problems.

- On contest day, replace student_datasets and prob01.py with your actual datasets and problem solutions.
